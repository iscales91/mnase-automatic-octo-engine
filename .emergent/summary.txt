The MNASE Basketball League website initially aimed to replicate an existing site, providing account management, facility rentals, event scheduling, registration, and member portals. This evolved into a 16-section product specification covering comprehensive features including foundation, information architecture, specific page content, detailed registration flows (with conditional logic and payment plans), scheduling, media, sponsorships, forms, and policies.

The current application boasts JWT authentication, distinct admin/member roles, CRUD operations for events/facilities, and Stripe payment integration. The UI features a MNASE logo, homepage image carousel, and dynamic navigation for Mentality Academy, Memberships, and Events. Key pages like About, Contact, FAQ, Shop, Policies, Get Involved, Recruitment, Sponsorship, Scores & Standings, and Foundation have been created. An interactive calendar displays events, and backend support exists for various forms. An enhanced 5-step registration form includes age verification, parent-child management, and email confirmations. The Admin Dashboard now supports User, Billing, Payment, Calendar, Form Submissions, Registrations, Teams, and Analytics management. The Member Dashboard has been enhanced to show activities and payment options for approved registrations. New features include a real email service (Gmail SMTP), image uploads, global search, notifications, advanced calendar views, a news/blog, a photo gallery, and testimonials.
