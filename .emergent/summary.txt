The AI engineer effectively addressed multiple user requests, transforming the MNASE Basketball League application. The work began with implementing a collapsible navigation bar, overcoming initial display issues on mobile and ensuring full functionality on desktop. Subsequently, the full month calendar view was fixed to prevent truncation, and then seamlessly integrated as a subpage under the Events tab. A comprehensive role-based UI visibility system was introduced, controlling access to dashboards and navigation elements. Significant backend and frontend development commenced for an affiliate ticket sales system with Stripe Connect, including new services, models, and dashboard components. Admin functionality was extended with FAQ management and color-coded event categories. Finally, a collapsible sidebar was implemented for member dashboards, and an attempt was made to fix desktop layout issues, immediately followed by the initiation of a global back button component.

<product_requirements>
The MNASE Basketball League app aims to be a feature-rich platform, mirroring an existing site for account management, facility rentals, event scheduling, and registrations with payments (Stripe). It supports JWT authentication, admin/member roles, and CRUD for core entities. Recent features include email, image uploads, global search, notifications, advanced calendar, news, gallery, and testimonials. Key explicit user requests addressed in this trajectory include:
1.  **Collapsible Home Screen Navigation Bar**: An accordion-style menu for mobile, keeping the logo visible, with slide animation.
2.  **Full Month Calendar Display**: The calendar view should display the entire month grid without scrolling or truncation.
3.  **Calendar as Subpage**: The calendar should be accessible as the first subpage under the Events tab.
4.  **Role-Based UI Visibility**: Staff roles (admin, super_admin, manager, coach, treasurer) access Admin Dashboard, regular users access Member Dashboard. Unauthorized users see a Restricted Access message. Public pages remain accessible to all.
5.  **Affiliate Ticket Sales System**: A comprehensive system for tracking and selling admission tickets, including:
    *   Unique selling links for adult participants/athletes.
    *   15% commission on sales via their link, tracked in Member Dashboard.
    *   Automatic fund dispersal via Stripe Connect on the first of each month.
    *   Affiliate application (approval required by Super Admin).
    *   Multiple ticket types (quantity, VIP seats).
    *   Admin features for affiliate/ticket management and payout approval/denial, setting commission rates.
6.  **FAQ Management**: Admin ability to add, edit, and delete frequently asked questions.
7.  **Event Creation Category**: Event creation should offer a dropdown for event types (tournament, game, camp, clinic, workshop, orientation, other) with color coding.
8.  **Dashboard Collapsible Sidebar**: All member dashboard options should be in a collapsible menu on the left side.
9.  **Desktop Layout Fix (Dashboard)**: Resolve issues where desktop layout (tabs/sidebar) is not displaying properly or causing horizontal scrolling.
10. **Back Button**: Implement a back button on all webpages.
